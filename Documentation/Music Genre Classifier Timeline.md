# Music Genre Classification Timeline

Submission deadline: 28th March 23:59

Complete tasks:

1. Create at least two more models (CSP and PCA)
2. Create CNNs that can read these files. Adjust them to the different quality images
3. Start grabbing accuracies of these models on their own with the different image qualities into an Excel file, and describe them
4. Start combining the models that we've got (combining image extraction so that a model will take an image from at least two of the models) and get statistics for these as well
5. Make a model that uses all four models together, and grab accuracy
6. Combine it with the prebuilt statistics from the .csv file, grab the accuracies, then document these
7. Finish the report

## 5-9th March

General objectives for this week:

- Create three/four separate kinds of models:
  - [x] Spectogram
  - [x] Mel-Spectograms
  - [x] Chroma Vector
  - [x] Onset Envelope
- Begin to work on the project brief (see the PDF for more information) by reworking the AI Systems Implementation Project Briefing word document
- Recreate the AI Imp Group work pdf, but have it be relevant to our project

Dates:

- 5-7th March:
  - No work unless we have the time, as we preparing for the Algorithms and AI in-class assignment
- 8th March:
  - Mateusz (Chroma Vector model)
  - Bernard (doing AI Imp Group work PDF)
- 9th March:
  - Bernard (doing AI Imp Group work PDF)
  - Daniel (start the report)
  - Amelie (Spectogram model)
  - Conor (Mel-Spectograms)
  - Mateusz (Chroma Vector model)

## 10-16th March

General objectives for this week:

- [ ] Create a program to turn all WAV files into CSP (common spatial pattern)
- [ ] Create Principle Component Analysis
- [ ] Grab the accuracies of these models on their own, with both the high, middle and low (different words to describe output) quality images

- Create two/three more models:
  - [ ] Fourier Transform
  - [ ] Tempo and Rhythm Features
- Attempt to combine two of the previous weeks models together (select any two to combine)
- Experiment with existing models (e.g. change number of layers/number of nodes within each layer) to compare the accuracy
- Continue writing the project brief
